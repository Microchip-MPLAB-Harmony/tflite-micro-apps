# **Micro Speech** example

This is ["micro speech"](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/tree/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/micro_speech) demo of TensorFlow Lite. This example shows how to run neural network model using Tensorflow Lite for microcontroller runtime engine to recognize 2 keywords, "yes" and "no", from speech data. The application listens to its surroundings with a microphone and indicates when it has detected a the keyword by lighting an LED or displaying data on a terminal.
