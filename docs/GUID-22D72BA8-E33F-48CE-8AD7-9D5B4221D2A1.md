# **Hello World** example

This is ["hello world"](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/tree/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/hello_world) demo of TensorFlow Lite. This example is designed to demonstrate the absolute basics of using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontroller. It uses pretrained ML model to predict the sin of an input. In a real-world application, if you needed the sine of x, you could just calculate it directly. However, by training a model to approximate the result, we can demonstrate the basics of machine learning.
